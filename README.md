# 3D Isometric in 2D
A project implementing isometric 3D effect in a pure 2D environment, built with **Godot 3.2.x**, but I think this is not difficult to implement on other engines/frameworks once you understand how this works, so I highly encourage you to do so.

This is also a rewrite of the core mechanic for my released game [Ladder Box](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444390):
